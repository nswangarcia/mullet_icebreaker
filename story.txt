One day Dr. Mehlhase was walking her hund in the Flughafen.
Then she bought a bratwurst and some gebaeck for her and her hund.
She walked along the hauptstrasse, and admired the array of shops and baeckerei along the central steet.
At full volume a nearby biergarten had a Rammstein cover band shredding their instruments and she was intrigued.
It wasn't the first time that this had happened (Berlin had many such places), but she hoped that she wouldn't get too distracted before heading for the Flughafen on her Porsche.
At a stoplight, a man in a BMW revved their engine taunting Dr. Mehlase to race them. 
Although she could have easily beaten the man in his BMW, she was in sight of the ratskeller she needed to stop at before arriving at the flughafen.
At that moment, Dr.Mehlhase caught a glimpse of a freshly baked apfelkuchen wafting the smell in the air, helping resist the temptation to race.
She decided to stop and buy the freshly baked apfelkuchen and went on her way; however, Dr. Mehlase could not fight the wettbewerbsfaehig urge to race.
The race went as far as Schloss Eltz, and Dr. Melhase won, much to the chagrin of the man in the BMW.
Dr. Melhase promptly went to to the baeckerei before heading on her way the the Flughafen in Berin.
When she finally got there, she bumped into a man wearing Lederhose who was carrying a small Klimaanlage.
The man dropped the Klimaanlage and a woman wearing a Dirndel came out from the Biergarten to help the man.
Afterward, they both went to get Gebaeck and Apfelkuchen together in the man's Porsche.
