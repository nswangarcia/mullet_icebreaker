One day Dr. Mehlhase was walking her hund in the Flughafen.
Then she bought a bratwurst and some gebaeck for her and her hund.
She walked along the hauptstrasse, and admired the array of shops and baeckerei along the central steet.
At full volume a nearby biergarten had a Rammstein cover band shredding their instruments and she was intrigued.
It wasn't the first time that this had happened (Berlin had many such places), but she hoped that she wouldn't get too distracted before heading for the Flughafen on her Porsche.
At a stoplight, a man in a BMW revved their engine taunting Dr. Mehlase to race them.
